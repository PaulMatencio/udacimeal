  "description": "This Chicken  Salad with Pomegranate  is the perfect fresh salad that still incorporates some of fallâ€™s goodies. Olive oil, salt & peeper, and a ton of italian seasoning, so that it almost forms a crust. So flavorful, and it can be added to a variety of salads or cut up for sandwiches.",
